when program starts
set movement motors to AC  # start: right wheel right side next to 10th line from right; arm 90 degrees
set movement speed to 50 %
set 1 motor rotation to 19.7 cm moved
B set speed to 30 %  # B= front Hawkbot  # D= front Hawk Red
B run clockwise for .3 rotations
move forward for 29.25 inches
run Gyro turn 5 50 75
B run counterclockwise for .5 rotations
run Gyro turn 0 -10 10
move back for 6 inches
stop moving
run Gyro turn -15 0 24
move back for 7 inches
stop moving
B set speed to 100 %
B run counterclockwise for .125 rotations

define Gyro turn left wheel speed right wheel speed turn degrees
set yaw angle to 0
start moving at left wheel speed right wheel speed % speed
wait until ((abs of yaw angle) > turn degrees)
stop moving
